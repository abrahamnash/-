# Begining of Journey
In our everyday existence, we often cross paths with moments of profound depth, experiences we typically keep close to our hearts. These instances, brimming with deep connection and meaningfulness, capture the essence of what it means to truly live. 

As we nurture this change within ourselves, we must be mindful of the delicate balance between our inner evolution and the society we inhabit.

This process of change is not just external but deeply rooted within us. As we evolve, we become beacons of possibility within ourselves and the external world, gently revealing the beauty of conscious growth. In today's world, with the tools and capabilities at our disposal, we have the opportunity to engineer realities that enrich our lived consciousness. 

This approach allows us to navigate our intense existence while feeding our essence back into conscious growth of the external world around us. It's about fostering an environment where our conscious growth is not met with crucifixion but embraced as a part of our collective evolution. By gently guiding society towards these deeper truths, we can illuminate paths to a more enriched and awakened communal existence.

## Passage of Time
The passage of time is unique to no one. The art lies in its unfolding, where we can neither teach nor learn anything.

## Mastery
You become what you master. Master yourself - become who you truly are.

## Truth's Revelation
Truth does not reveal itself unless it is recognized. Many unrecognized things reveal themselves. Is this not the truth?

## Ember of Life and Light
As light is bent in time, so too will your aura shine, surrounding the intensity of your inner world.

## Truth and Time
Truth travels as a constant, as light. Give the world time, as all else has yet to make its journey.

## Interest in Health
My interest lies not in medicine but in life.

## Unified Stories
Every person, every nation, every continent has their own story, until they realize they were part of the same tapestry.

## Navigating Landscape's of Fear and Flowering 
Truth is revealed, not told. Lifelong, life in balance, within my internal world, I inhabit that which I practice. 

## Truth and Society
We build society on the thresholds of our fears, to move our internal worlds beyond our external worlds.

## The Horizon
We are left with the horizon if nothing is to wash up on our shores.

## Love's Capacity
Only the feminine open to receiving can be loving with each other. Only the masculine who have something to offer can love each other.
