## Passage of Time
The passage of time is unique to no one. The art lies in its unfolding, where we can neither teach nor learn anything.

## Dear Flower
Overwhelmed by your sheer beauty, dear flower, you awaken and revitalize me. Beholding you respond to the sun, I am transported to the conscious interplay and nature of life.

## Mastery
You become what you master. Master yourself - become who you truly are.

## The Horizon
If nothing is to wash up on our shores, we are left with the horizon.

## Interest in Health
My interest lies not in medicine but in health.

## Unified Stories
Every person, every nation, every continent has their own story, until they realize they were part of the same story.

## Truth and Society
Truth is revealed, not told. I cannot learn about truth. Lifelong, life in balance, within my internal world, I inhabit that which I practice. We build society on our fears, to move our internal worlds beyond our external worlds.

## Love's Capacity
Only the feminine open to receiving can be loving with each other. Only the masculine who have something to offer can love each other. 

## Truth's Revelation
Truth does not reveal itself unless it is recognized. Many other things in the world reveal themselves.
