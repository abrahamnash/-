## Union: Life, Journey, and Light

Understanding these cycles of our form is not about dwelling on the end but about enriching our life as artful energies of expression. It enables us to live more consciously, and authentically. By enabling ourselves to engage beyond these dualities while recognizing and acknowledging their artful interplay, we can find a more profound connection with life, embracing the dualities that define our existence.

## Union
Nature thrives on cycles â€“ birth, growth, decay, death, and rebirth - it is all a part of the same journey. 

If we take reality as a form of the whole, and pull it apart in different ways, it will seek union - this occurs in the world, each with varying degrees of complexity. Form, the infinite, is pulled apart into a profound existence - this is form undergoing expression and interplay, to understand itself more profoundly - it can be thought of as divine hygiene. In the same way, that we learn and re-adjust ourselves in the nature of who we are is source itslef undergoing a delicate play of introspection. Time, infinite, is unfolding to play in understanding, returning to its form upon this expression, of which it has undergone a subtle shift in its transformation before it re-finds itself It is a hygenic expression of the divine, undergoing internal shifts to settle itself, in a way that it finds balance in its form, and discovers itself with more internal expressions, can be said to be the source of our existence. 

In the intricate dance of existence, understanding life is as vital as understanding our journey beyond and back, as a duality of one and the same. Both are not merely events or states, but intertwined dimensions of the same reality, deeply informing and reflecting each other in an intricate dance and play.

## Life

Our entry into this world is a convergence of energies, responding and finding form. This transition between life and other planes of existence, or non existence is more than a passage; it's an interplay of expressions drawn apart to play itself in different ways back together. Appreciating this connection offers a deeper engagement with both aspects of our existence.

Naturally, we are a part of this form, expressing art - this is how many paths lead us to realization. Source is re-realising itself in many ways, and the nature of life is thus creative expression of these internal shifts and art forms of divine expression and discovery of an aspect we may call as 'self'. There are infinite ways to realize ourselves, and infinite art forms of expression we are afforded during this hygenic internal discovery. As it is said - there are many paths to realisation. This is the beuaty of our joruney - artforms, and a the abilit y for coinscious development of appreciation int his experession.  By embracing this asepct of our world, we gain insight into the perpetual motions to not only be as artful participants, but to develop as aspect of ourselves to observe them in a way that contains conscious discretion. Observing offers us a new dimension of experience that is conscious.

## Journey 
Journeying has been replaced with a misconception, a word that is known wrongly as death - not grammatically, but in its interpretivesssence, is a misconception of fear that has led to illness - we have created an ego-form that we have disabled it's ability to change, and as a result become trapped by it and fear it. This is not the answer- embrace a re-definition of this word as a duality of plane of existence.

Neither life nor it's duality, should be opposed as battlegrounds, but simply recognized as one form - the turbulence of life, is met with the stillness of the other side. Our very first cry at birth is a testament to this transition. Yet, it's in this juxtaposition that we find a contextual essence of 'being.' 

De-identify with the physical form, and reach out to sense life energies pervading through the sphere of existence. We shed our bodies, yet, our energies persist in artform which beckon other life forms in resonance. Each form we inhabit wields our artform of energies. Your journey is a possibility of offering art in in this form that may linger in this world. 

A common misunderstanding, is this duality is not a battleground but a confluence that enriches the source from which our energies spring. This simple realigment, can shape our actions in the world that enrich our lives - otherwise, be sure that truth will follow. Truth unless lived, often hits us in the face as unresolved pain bodies of the self, or collective.

## Light
Light is a form of expression, drawn toward the intensity of our potentiation. Embers of light, flow aorund singularities in space which hold our realities - this is true internally. We too may emit our internal insensitive, as emebers of light pervade beyond our beings, seeping through our pores of life. 

To lean too far towards one is to inevitably draw closer to the other, for death fears life just as life fears death, creating a magnetic pull between these existential states, beckoning form to dance between one and the other. Yet, a fragment of our consciousness has the potential to transcend these opposites, evolving into a form that is aware, conscious, and indivisible growing inside. We are not just participants in this journey; we are called to it, graced by the opportunity to merge with this perpetual cycle, dissolving the illusion of separation and embracing the oneness that beckons us.

Embracing these dualities can create a new form within us, that recognizes an aspect that lies beyond these dualities. It's about nurturing and recognizing life in its many forms. The awareness of our journeys end in this context doesn't lead to fear but a deeper connection with the life force that sustains us beyond to 'be' that which is form, and formless.
