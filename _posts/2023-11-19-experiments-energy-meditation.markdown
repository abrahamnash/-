# Blog 14: Experiments of Energy and Meditation - A Diary of Recount

## The Symphony of Spiritual Energy

1. **A Hum of Energy into New Body:**
   Every meditation session feels like entering a new body. A sensation, sometimes subtle, sometimes profound, courses through me — the gentle hum of energy. It's a reminder that our physical form is just a vessel, ever-receptive to the energies around and within us.

2. **Gravitational Attunement:**
   To align with intuition means to attune oneself gravitationally with external forces. It's a dance of separation and re-entrance. We first detach to understand the greater forces at play, and then re-enter, recalibrated and re-centered.

3. **Merging and Detaching with Realities:**
   As we meditate, we find ourselves merging with different realities, feeling one with them, and then consciously detaching. It's a practice that teaches us the impermanence of existence and the continuous flow of consciousness.

4. **Service to Ourselves:**
   The primary service in meditation is to ourselves. However, by refining our energies and elevating our consciousness, we inevitably serve others. Our heightened vibrations resonate outwards, touching and uplifting those around us.

5. **Alignment with Higher Self:**
   Our higher self is our guiding compass, and aligning with it means aligning with our intuition, bolstering our self-esteem, and fostering kinship with life's processes. It’s an intricate balance between involvement in the external world and the detachment necessary for introspection.

6. **Ecosystems of Force and Energies:**
   Every meditation feels like diving deep into an ecosystem of energies. There are currents to ride, depths to explore, and forces to tap into. With practice, we become adept at navigating these ecosystems, drawing from their vast reservoirs.

7. **Holding Centres:**
   Envision a straight line amid the undulating sine waves of life. Adding a third dimension to this is directionality. Moving into different spheres of existence requires escaping their gravitational pulls. By centering ourselves, we remove ourselves from all these pulls and cycles. The process often manifests as heat in the body, a palpable price of burning our karmic ties.

8. **The Practice:**
   Conducting these experiments, navigating energies, holding centers, and aligning with forces is our spiritual practice. It is rigorous, demanding, yet deeply rewarding.

9. **The Time it Takes:**
   Progress in this journey can be slow. Years might pass with only subtle shifts. But every moment invested internally reaps dividends in the form of heightened awareness, deeper peace, and a more profound connection to the universe.

10. **Your Call in This Lifetime:**
    Not everyone feels the pull to embark on this journey in every lifetime. It's a call, a beckoning from the soul. If you feel it, know that passivity won’t suffice. The journey of discovery is active, demanding, and, above all, transformative.

In this vast universe, as we experiment with energy and meditation, we realize we are both the explorer and the explored, the seeker and the sought. The dance of energy is intricate, and every session is a step closer to understanding the grand design.

## The Reset and the Play of Faith

In the journey of spiritual exploration, there are moments when a reset becomes essential. A pause, a recalibration, a return to the essence. This reset, more often than not, challenges our faith. As we await the various realities to play out and align with our inner vision, there's an underlying uncertainty, an anticipation.

The heightened energy centers within us play a pivotal role in this process. As our energies circulate, moving upward to higher centers, there's a palpable sensation in our physical form. This flow can resonate imagery cast in light. It's an extraordinary experience where light, with its supreme speed — the highest known constant in our universe, gives us glimpses of events and realities before they physically manifest.

Seeing ahead of time is not merely a fantastical ability; it's a translation of our inner recreation of the world's external materials. When we harness this capability, it feels as though we're ahead of the curve, experiencing and envisioning outcomes before they come into tangible existence. This precognition is anchored in the understanding that light moves faster than the time it takes for our physical reality to manifest.

It's crucial to understand that this isn't about predicting the future in a divinatory sense. It's about tapping into a higher frequency of existence, where the boundaries of time are more malleable. It's a process of aligning with light, the most immediate reflection of creation, and through meditative processes, deconstructing and understanding the ability to see and feel the echoes of events yet to unfold.
