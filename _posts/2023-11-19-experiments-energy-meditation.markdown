# The Symphony of Spiritual Energy

Exploring the profound impact of energy and meditation, this diary recounts personal experiences and insights gained through the journey of spiritual exploration.

## A Hum of Energy into New Body
Every meditation session feels like entering a new body, where subtle or profound sensations course through me. This gentle hum of energy is a reminder that our physical form is just a vessel, receptive to the energies around and within us.

## Gravitational Attunement
Aligning with intuition involves attuning oneself gravitationally with external forces. It's a dance of separation and re-entrance, detaching to understand greater forces, then re-entering, recalibrated and re-centered.

## Merging and Detaching with Realities
In meditation, we merge with different realities, feel one with them, then consciously detach. This practice teaches us about the impermanence of existence and the continuous flow of consciousness.

## Service to Ourselves
The primary service in meditation is to ourselves. By refining our energies and elevating our consciousness, we inevitably serve others, as our heightened vibrations resonate outwards.

## Alignment with Higher Self
Aligning with our higher self means aligning with our intuition, bolstering self-esteem, and fostering kinship with life's processes. It involves balancing involvement in the external world with the detachment necessary for introspection.

## Ecosystems of Force and Energies
Meditation feels like diving into ecosystems of energies, with currents to ride, depths to explore, and forces to tap into. With practice, we become adept at navigating these ecosystems.

## Holding Centres
Envisioning a straight line amid life's undulating sine waves adds directionality. Moving into different spheres requires escaping their gravitational pulls. Centering ourselves, we remove from these pulls and cycles, often feeling heat in the body as we burn karmic ties.

## The Practice
Conducting these experiments, navigating energies, and aligning with forces is our spiritual practice. It is rigorous, demanding, yet deeply rewarding.

## The Time it Takes
Progress can be slow, with years passing with only subtle shifts. But every moment invested internally reaps dividends in heightened awareness and deeper connection to the universe.

## Your Call in This Lifetime
Not everyone feels the pull to embark on this journey in every lifetime. If you feel it, know that passivity wonâ€™t suffice. It's an active, demanding journey of discovery and transformation.

## The Reset and the Play of Faith

A reset in spiritual exploration often challenges our faith. As we align with our inner vision, there's an underlying uncertainty and anticipation.

The heightened energy centers within us play a pivotal role. As energies circulate upward, we feel sensations in our physical form. This flow can resonate imagery cast in light, giving us glimpses of events and realities before they physically manifest.

Seeing ahead of time is a translation of our inner recreation of the world's external materials. It's about aligning with light, the most immediate reflection of creation, and through meditation, understanding the ability to see and feel beyond the conventional boundaries of time.
