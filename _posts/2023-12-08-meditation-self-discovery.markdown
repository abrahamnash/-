Meditation is often misconstrued as a mere practice, a routine exercise to be performed with discipline. However, at its core, meditation is a journey of self-discovery, an exploration of the depths within us. It's not about adhering to a strict practice but about remembering and exploring ourselves.

## Forget the Practice, Remember Yourself

The essence of meditation lies in exploration. If your intuition guides you to sit quietly in your room for hours, embrace it. This isn't odd; it's a process of genuine contemplation. Original meditation was about contemplation, and the forms it takes – be it sitting, standing, or moving – are byproducts of this internal exploration.

## The Byproduct of Form

Our physical forms often reflect our internal states. When we're awake and alert, our posture is responsive. When we're tired, we lie down. Similarly, in contemplation, our bodies naturally find positions that reflect our inner state. This understanding is where the current confusion about yoga and its mimicry lies. Yoga, in its truest sense, is the alignment of our physical form with our inner contemplation.

## Inner World Sustains Our Forms

Our physical forms are sustained and influenced by our inner world. This is the crux of contemplation and, essentially, yoga. It's not just about replicating physical postures but about aligning our outer expressions with our inner explorations.

## Exploring Diverse Cultures and Scriptures

Various cultures and ancient reflective writings, not necessarily religious, offer insights into these forms of exploration. They provide a rich tapestry of perspectives on how our inner contemplation shapes our physical expression in meditation.

## Conclusion

As we delve deeper into the realm of meditation, let's shift our focus from rigid practices to a fluid exploration of self. Let meditation be a reflection of our inner journey, a means to explore the vast landscape within us. In doing so, we align more authentically with ourselves, discovering meditation not as a practice but as a profound form of self-discovery.
